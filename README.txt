A simple Moodle filter that processes mp4 files and outputs some embed code including a video player and links to download the file.

This filter was based on http://www.andykemp.org.uk/2009/07/mp4s-in-moodle/ 

This filter expects the vidoe, the preview image, and the download link to share the same filename, and only differ by extension.

You will be much happier if you create text resources and not web pages since the moodle wysiwyg editor mangles the embed codes 
upon saving.
