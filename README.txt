A simple Moodle filter that processes mp4 files and outputs some embed code including a video player and links to download the file.

This filter was based on http://www.andykemp.org.uk/2009/07/mp4s-in-moodle/ 

This filter expects the vidoe, the preview image, and the download link to share the same filename, and only differ by extension.

This work was created at CCNMTL (http://ccnmtl.columbia.edu).
